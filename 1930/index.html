      A gift from Elías García Martínez, the artwork was painted directly onto
      the wall of the Santuario de Misericordia church in the Spanish town of
      Borja in around 1930, and until 2012 had existed in relative obscurity.

      The work is unimposing in size, measuring just twenty inches in height and
      sixteen inches in width, and was originally painted by Martínez in a style
      strikingly similar to that of the high-Baroque works of Italian artist
      Guido Reni (1575-1642).

        Whilst general opinion amongst the press treated the fresco as “a work of little artistic importance,” because “Martínez is not a great artist and his painting Ecce Homo is not a ‘masterpiece,’” the fresco nevertheless held some sentimental value within the local community; residents’ attachment to it stemmed from an interest in historical preservation and general artistic authenticity as much as the inherent sanctity associated with the artwork.
