            From a historical fresco to an internet sensation,
            <em>Ecce Homo</em> is a masterpiece in its own unique way, its
            botched restoration putting its small town in Spain on the radar of
            many tourists.

            Around the year 1930, in a small Spanish town of Borja, a painter by
            the name of Elías García Martínez painted a fresco directly on the
            wall of the Santuario de Misericordia church as a gift.

          <div class="A_body-text-02">
            Titled <em>Ecco Homo</em>, translated as 'Behold the Man', the
            fresco had the height and width of twenty and sixteen inches
            respectively. Its style echoed that of Italian artist Guido Reni's
            high-Baroque works.

            The fresco had a very humble beginning. General opinion amongst the
            press about it was that it was "a work of little artistic
            importance" and that “Martínez is not a great artist and his
            painting Ecce Homo is not a ‘masterpiece'".

          <div class="A_body-text-04">
            However, it became a form of sentimental value among the locals,
            originated from a shared passion for historical preservation, as
            well as appreciation and respect for the artwork.

            In just 80 years however, Elías García Martínez’s Ecce Homo begin to
            fade, caused by moisture damage. As a result, much of the details of
            the painting has been compromised.

          <div class="B_body-text-02">
            The sight of the deteoriated painting greatly troubled 80-year-old
            Cecilia Giménez, a parishioner of the church and amateur painter.
            With the blessing of the priest, Giménez put her artistic skills to
            the test, in a bid to restore the fresco to its former glory.

            Unfortunately, the attempt backfired tremendously, and news of
            Giménez's failure was reported by the Spanish newspaper, Heraldo, on
            August 21, 2012. The article spread like wildfire throughout the
            internet, propelling the painting to fame.

            The silver lining that came with this incident however, was that
            since the fresco's dramatic makeover, its once quiet town of Borja
            is now booming with tourism, attracting more than 150,000 tourists
            from around the globe.
