# Project_01
In this project, you will select a static and/or physical item (such as a printed text, image, document, sculpture, or physical object) and translate it into a digital format. The goal is to explore how digital tools can alter the way we interact with, interpret, and present physical items.

## Assignment Goals
- Explore the creative process of translating analog (physical) forms into digital formats.
- Analyze the impact of digital media on the meaning and form of the chosen item.
- Apply digital technologies such as HTML, CSS, image editing, or other tools at your disposal to reimagine your chosen item in a digital environment.
