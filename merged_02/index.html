          A gift from Elías García Martínez, the artwork was painted directly
          onto the wall of the Santuario de Misericordia church in the Spanish
          town of Borja in around 1930, and until 2012 had existed in relative
          obscurity.

        <div class="A_body-text-02">
          The work is unimposing in size, measuring just twenty inches in height
          and sixteen inches in width, and was originally painted by Martínez in
          a style strikingly similar to that of the high-Baroque works of
          Italian artist Guido Reni (1575-1642).

          Whilst general opinion amongst the press treated the fresco as “a work
          of little artistic importance,” because “Martínez is not a great
          artist and his painting Ecce Homo is not a ‘masterpiece,’” the fresco
          nevertheless held some sentimental value within the local community;
          residents’ attachment to it stemmed from an interest in historical
          preservation and general artistic authenticity as much as the inherent
          sanctity associated with the artwork.

          The problem was, Elías García Martínez’s Ecce Homo was only 80 years old and had already begun to fade. Jesus’s crown looked less thorny, his face had lost its sheen, and his crimson tunic was slowly flaking off.

      <div class="B_body-text-02">
          This distressed Cecilia Giménez, an 80-year-old parishioner who, as luck would have it, was also an amateur artist. So, with the priest’s blessing, Giménez got to work, layering heavy blocks of color onto the fresco.
      </div>
  
      <div class="B_body-text-03">
        Giménez’s attempt to restore the fresco failed tremendously and,
        On August 21, 2012, the global online community erupted, following reports
        by the Spanish newspaper Heraldo of the failed attempt.

      <div class="B_body-text-04">
          Since the makeover, the image has attracted more than 150,000 tourists from around the world — Japan, Brazil, the United States — to the gothic 16th century Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mercy on a mountain overlooking Borja.
