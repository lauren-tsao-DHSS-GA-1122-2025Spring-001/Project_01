        The problem was, Elías García Martínez’s Ecce Homo was only 80 years old and had already begun to fade. Jesus’s crown looked less thorny, his face had lost its sheen, and his crimson tunic was slowly flaking off.

    <div class="A_body-text-02">
        This distressed Cecilia Giménez, an 80-year-old parishioner who, as luck would have it, was also an amateur artist. So, with the priest’s blessing, Giménez got to work, layering heavy blocks of color onto the fresco.

    <div class="A_body-text-03">
      Giménez’s attempt to restore the fresco failed tremendously and,
      On August 21, 2012, the global online community erupted, following reports
      by the Spanish newspaper Heraldo of the failed attempt.

        Since the makeover, the image has attracted more than 150,000 tourists from around the world — Japan, Brazil, the United States — to the gothic 16th century Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mercy on a mountain overlooking Borja.
